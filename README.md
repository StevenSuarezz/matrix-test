As part of our Business licenses, we offer an automated mobile application security testing tool referred to as MATRIX. The goal of MATRIX is to be a compelling and cost-effective DevSecOps solution. By harnessing the power of virtual devices, you can test your mobile applications on a wide range of devices without the need to purchase and maintain their physical counterparts.

By building on the scalability and convenience of our cloud-based virtual devices, Corellium's MATRIX solution drastically reduces the effort, cost and time of penetration testing; enabling you to invest more into your security processes and ship more secure apps.

This is a testing repository for our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/corellium/matrix).
